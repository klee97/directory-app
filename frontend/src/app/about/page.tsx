          About Us
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          As two Asian American women, we understand how difficult it is to find wedding artists who know how to highlight your natural beauty.
          A makeup artist who is an experienced professional is not necessarily experienced with Asian features or styles of makeup.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          We&apos;re building this directory to help Asian couples find artists who are recommended within their local communities.
          We&apos;re asking our friends and family, scouring the web, scrolling Instagram, and looking through Reddit and Facebook, so you don&apos;t have to.
          The artists here are people who other couples have recommended, and we&apos;re excited to share their recommendations with you.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          Whether you&apos;re a vendor looking to showcase your work or a couple planning your big day, we&apos;re here to help.
