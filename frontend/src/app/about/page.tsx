        As two Asian American women, we understand how overwhelming wedding planning can beâ€”especially when you&apos;re straddling the line between different cultures. 
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
        We&apos;re building this directory to help Asian couples find artists who are recommended within their local communities.
        We&apos;re asking our friends and family, scouring the web, and looking through Reddit and Facebook, so you don&apos;t have to.
        The artists here are people who other couples have recommended, and we&apos;re excited to share their knowledge with you.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
        Whether you&apos;re a vendor looking to showcase your work or a couple planning your big day, we&apos;re here to help.
