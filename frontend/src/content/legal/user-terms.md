# TERMS OF SERVICE

*Last Updated: February 11, 2026*

These Terms of Service (**"Terms"**) govern your access to and use of our wedding vendor directory services available at asianweddingmakeup.com (the **"Site"**) and any related services we provide (collectively, the **"Services"**). The Services are operated by White Rabbit Brides LLC, doing business as Asian Wedding Makeup (**"we"**, **"us"**, or **"our"**).

These Terms apply to anyone who accesses or uses our Site or Services (**"Users"** or **"you"**). *Vendors who create partner accounts and use our vendor portal are also subject to separate [Vendor Terms of Service](/vendor-terms) in addition to these Terms.*

**By accessing or using the Site or Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.** If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Site or Services.

## 1. Overview of Services

We operate a wedding vendor directory platform that connects Users with wedding vendors. The Platform curates vendors based on demonstrated experience, skill, and relevance to its intended audience. Vendor inclusion is not based on the vendor’s race, ethnicity, or personal identity.

Our Services allow you to:

- Browse and search our directory of wedding vendors
- View vendor profiles, services, pricing, and portfolios
- Submit inquiries to vendors you're interested in working with
- Create an account to save favorite vendors and manage your preferences
- Receive wedding planning resources and vendor recommendations

## 2. Account Registration and Security

### 2.1 Account Creation

While you may browse our directory without an account, creating an account allows you to save favorite vendors and manage your wedding planning preferences. When you create an account, you must:

- Provide accurate, current, and complete information
- Maintain and promptly update your account information
- Be at least 18 years of age
- Maintain the security of your password and account

### 2.2 Account Responsibility

You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain account security or from unauthorized access to your account.

## 3. Nature of Platform: Vendor Recommendations and Limitations

We are a directory platform, not a wedding vendor. We provide a curated platform that recommends and connects users with independent third-party vendors. We do not provide wedding services such as makeup, photography, catering, or any other wedding-related services ourselves.

Some vendor profiles displayed on the Platform may be unclaimed and prepopulated by us using publicly available information. These profiles are provided for discovery and informational purposes only. We do not represent that such vendors have a relationship with us, have reviewed their profiles, or have agreed to be listed on the Platform.

### 3.1 Our Recommendations and Limitations

We curate our directory and provide vendor recommendations to help you find wedding professionals. However, we do not guarantee, warrant, or assume responsibility for the performance, quality, or conduct of any vendor. While we aim to feature quality vendors in our directory:

- We do not guarantee vendor credentials, licenses, insurance, or qualifications will remain current
- We do not conduct ongoing background checks or continuous monitoring of vendors
- We do not guarantee the quality, safety, legality, timeliness, or accuracy of vendor services
- We cannot verify all information in vendor profiles, portfolios, reviews, or pricing in real-time
- We do not monitor or control vendor conduct, service delivery, or business practices after they join our directory
- Vendor performance may vary and is beyond our control

Our recommendations are based on information available to us at the time of listing and do not constitute a guarantee of vendor performance or suitability for your specific needs.

### 3.2 Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for: (a) evaluating vendors before engaging their services; (b) conducting your own due diligence, including checking current references, reviews, licenses, and insurance; (c) negotiating terms, pricing, and contracts directly with vendors; (d) ensuring vendors meet your specific needs and standards; and (e) resolving any disputes with vendors directly.

We strongly encourage you to: meet with vendors in person or virtually, check references, verify credentials and insurance, read contracts carefully, and ensure vendors are the right fit for your wedding before making commitments.

## 4. Vendor Inquiries and Communications

When you submit an inquiry to a vendor through our platform, we transmit your inquiry information (including your name, email, wedding details, preferences, budget, and message) to that vendor. By submitting an inquiry, you:

- Consent to us sharing your inquiry information with the selected vendor(s)
- Authorize the vendor to contact you directly via email
- Understand that all subsequent communications and transactions occur directly between you and the vendor
- Acknowledge that we are not a party to any agreement you enter into with a vendor

We do not guarantee that vendors will respond to your inquiry or that responses will meet your expectations.

## 5. Acceptable Use Policy

You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:

- Use the Services in any way that violates any applicable law or regulation
- Submit false, misleading, or fraudulent inquiries or information
- Spam vendors with excessive or duplicate inquiries
- Harass, abuse, threaten, or intimidate vendors or other users
- Scrape, harvest, or collect vendor data or user information from the Site

### 6.3 Unclaimed Vendor Profiles

Some vendor profiles displayed on the Platform have not been claimed by the vendor through our vendor portal ("Unclaimed Profiles").

Unclaimed Profiles is either obtained from publicly available sources or provided directly by the vendor.

Unclaimed Profiles are provided for informational and discovery purposes only and do not constitute an endorsement, guarantee, or recommendation 
of any vendor or their services. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of such information and are not responsible 
for errors or omissions. We do not represent that vendors with Unclaimed Profiles have a current relationship with us or have recently reviewed
