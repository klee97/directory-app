In certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information to third parties for legitimate purposes subject to this Privacy Policy.

### 4.1 Disclosure of User Inquiry Information to Vendors

When a User submits an inquiry through our Platform, we disclose the User’s inquiry information to the Vendor selected by the User so that the Vendor may respond to the request.

Inquiry information may include the User’s name, email address, event details (such as date and location), service preferences, budget information, and any message provided.

This disclosure is necessary to provide the core functionality of our Services.

Upon receiving full inquiry information, the Vendor acts as an independent data controller with respect to that information. The Vendor’s use of inquiry data is governed by its own privacy practices, applicable law, and the obligations described in Section 13.1 below and our [Vendor Terms of Service](/vendor-terms).

We are not responsible for a Vendor’s independent handling of inquiry information after it has been disclosed to the Vendor.
