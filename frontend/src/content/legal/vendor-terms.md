# VENDOR TERMS OF SERVICE

These Vendor Terms of Service (**"Vendor Terms"**) govern your use of the vendor partner portal and services available through asianweddingmakeup.com (the **"Platform"**).

These Vendor Terms apply to all wedding vendors who create vendor accounts, claim business profiles, or use our vendor portal (**"Vendors"** or **"you"**).

**By creating a vendor account, claiming your business profile, or using our vendor services, you agree to be bound by these Vendor Terms and our general Terms of Service.** These Vendor Terms supplement and are in addition to our general Terms of Service. In the event of any conflict between these Vendor Terms and the general Terms of Service, these Vendor Terms shall control with respect to vendor-specific matters. If you do not agree to these Vendor Terms, you may not use our vendor services.

## 2. Vendor Account Registration and Profile Management

### 2.1 Profile Creation and Prepopulation

**We do not include client photos, creative content, or subjective descriptions in prepopulated profiles.** Prepopulated profiles contain only basic factual business information to help prospective clients discover your services.

**Profile prepopulation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an endorsement or guarantee.** We make reasonable efforts to ensure accuracy but cannot verify all prepopulated information in real-time.

**Verified Badge:** Profiles that have been claimed and are actively managed by the vendor will display a "Verified" badge to distinguish them from prepopulated profiles. Only claimed profiles can be marked as verified.

## 4. Inquiry System and Payment Terms

### 4.1 Pay-Per-Inquiry Model

Our Platform operates on a pay-per-inquiry model. When a prospective client (bride or couple) submits an inquiry to your business through the Platform, you receive an email notification and may choose to purchase that lead to receive the full inquiry details and contact the prospective client.

**This is not a subscription service.** You only pay when you choose to purchase individual inquiries on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### 4.2 Inquiry Pricing

Pricing for inquiries is determined by us at our sole discretion and may vary based on:

- The monetary value of services requested
- Geographic market and demand
- Inquiry quality and completeness
- Other factors relevant to lead value

We reserve the right to adjust pricing at any time, but price changes will not apply to inquiries you have already purchased.

### 4.3 Complimentary Inquiries

We may, at our sole discretion, provide you with complimentary inquiries at no charge. These may be offered:

- As a promotional credit for new vendors
- For testing or quality assurance purposes
- As goodwill gestures or to resolve service issues
- At any other time we deem appropriate

Complimentary inquiries have no cash value and are provided without any guarantee or obligation on our part.

### 4.4 Inquiry
A valid inquiry is a submission from a prospective client through the Platform that includes:

- Contact information (first name, last name, and email address)
- Estimated wedding date
- Estimated number of people

Invalid inquiries include:

- **Spam Inquiries:** Automated submissions, bot-generated messages, or mass form submissions with no genuine interest
- **Test Inquiries:** Submissions made by us or third parties solely for testing purposes (unless disclosed as complimentary)
- **Duplicate Inquiries:** Multiple identical or substantially similar inquiries from the same prospective client within [X DAYS]
- **Fraudulent Inquiries:** Submissions containing false information or made with intent to defraud
- **Incomplete Inquiries:** Submissions lacking essential information needed to respond (contact information, wedding date, or service interest)

We make reasonable efforts to filter invalid inquiries before they reach you, but we cannot guarantee that all inquiries will be valid.

### 4.5 Inquiry Notification and Payment Process

When a prospective client submits an inquiry to your business:

1. You will receive an email notification to your public-facing or registered email address 
2. The notification will include limited preview information about the inquiry
4. To receive the full inquiry details and contact information, you must purchase the inquiry
5. Payment is currently processed via a third-party or in-platform  [udpate this?]
6. Once payment is confirmed, you will receive the full inquiry details via email, typically within several hours. We aim to deliver inquiries promptly but cannot guarantee specific delivery times due to technical or operational factors.

**Timing:** We aim to deliver full inquiry details within 6 hours of payment confirmation, but delivery times may vary due to technical issues or circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

### 4.6 Payment Methods and Invoicing

Payment is processed through our payment processor using your selected payment method. We reserve the right to change payment 
methods, processors, or implement in-platform payment processing with notice to vendors.

### 4.7 Real Response Guarantee

When you purchase an inquiry, we guarantee two things:

1. **Real Inquiry:** The inquiry is from a legitimate prospective client or wedding planner, not spam, bots, or fraudulent submissions
   
2. **Real Response:** The prospective client will respond to your initial outreach within 14 days

If either guarantee is not met, you may request an account credit for a future inquiry.

**How to Claim:**

**For Spam/Invalid Inquiries:**
If the inquiry is clearly spam, fraudulent, or from a bot, email support@mail.weddingmakeup.com within 30 days with evidence.

**For Non-Responsive Clients:**
If a legitimate client doesn't respond within 14 days of your 
initial outreach, email [VENDOR SUPPORT EMAIL] within 60 days with:
- Evidence of your outreach attempt
- Confirmation client hasn't responded

**When the Guarantee Doesn't Apply:**

We may deny credit requests if:
- Client responded off-platform (phone, text, direct email)
- You encouraged client not to respond to game this policy
- You failed to respond to the inquiry promptly
- Client responded but didn't book your services (normal business)
- Client's budget didn't match (normal business)

**Credit Details:**
- Credits can be used for future inquiry purchases
- Credits [DO NOT EXPIRE / EXPIRE AFTER 12 MONTHS]
- Credits are provided as account credit, not cash refunds

**Our Commitment:** While we implement spam filtering and lead 
quality processes, no system is perfect. This guarantee is our 
commitment to vendor satisfaction and platform quality.


### 4.8 Non-Circumvention and Platform Use

You agree not to circumvent the Platform or avoid inquiry fees by:

- Requesting prospective clients to contact you directly outside the Platform to avoid paying for inquiries
- Using information from inquiry previews to contact prospective clients without purchasing the full inquiry
- Sharing inquiry information with other vendors or third parties who have not paid for the inquiry
- Creating multiple vendor accounts to receive duplicate inquiries without payment
- Any other conduct intended to avoid or reduce inquiry fees

**Consequences:** Violation of this non-circumvention policy may result in:
- Immediate suspension or termination of your vendor account
- Forfeiture of any account credits or benefits
- Legal action to recover fees owed plus reasonable attorneys' fees
