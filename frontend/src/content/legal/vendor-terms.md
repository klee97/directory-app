# VENDOR TERMS OF SERVICE

*Last Updated: February 12, 2026*

These Vendor Terms of Service (**"Vendor Terms"**) govern your use of the vendor partner portal and services available through asianweddingmakeup.com (the **"Platform"**). The Platform is operated by White Rabbit Brides LLC, doing business as Asian Wedding Makeup (**"we"**, **"us"**, or **"our"**).

These Vendor Terms apply to all wedding vendors who create vendor accounts, claim business profiles, or use our vendor portal (**"Vendors"** or **"you"**).

**By creating a vendor account, claiming your business profile, or using our vendor services, you agree to be bound by these Vendor Terms and our general Terms of Service.** These Vendor Terms supplement and are in addition to our general [Terms of Service](/terms). In the event of any conflict between these Vendor Terms and the general Terms of Service, these Vendor Terms shall control with respect to vendor-specific matters. If you do not agree to these Vendor Terms, you may not use our vendor services.

## 1. Overview of Vendor Services

We operate a curated wedding vendor directory platform designed to connect couples planning weddings with wedding professionals. The Platform curates vendors based on demonstrated experience, skill, and relevance to its intended audience. Vendor inclusion is not based on the vendor’s race, ethnicity, or personal identity.

As a vendor on our Platform, you can:

- Claim and manage your business profile at no cost
- Edit your business information, services, pricing, and portfolio
- Receive qualified wedding inquiries from prospective clients
- Purchase leads on a pay-per-inquiry basis
- Showcase your work to couples planning their weddings
- Display a directory membership badge on your website (see Section 3.8)

## 2. Vendor Account Registration and Profile Management

### 2.1 When These Vendor Terms Apply

These Vendor Terms apply only once you claim your profile and create a vendor account. 

If you have not claimed your profile, only our general Terms of Service apply to the display of your business information on the Platform. See our general [Terms of Service Section 6.3](/terms#63-vendor-content) for information about how we display unclaimed vendor profiles.

If your business is not yet listed on the Platform and you would like to 
be considered for inclusion, please contact us at support@mail.asianweddingmakeup.com.

By claiming your profile, you represent and warrant that you are authorized 
to represent the business and manage its listing on our Platform.

**Verified Checkmark:** Profiles that have been claimed and are actively managed by the vendor will display a "Verified" checkmark to distinguish them from unclaimed profiles.

Once you claim your profile, you gain the ability to:

- Directly edit business information, descriptions, services, and pricing
- Upload and manage photos in your portfolio

## 4. Inquiry System and Payment Terms

### 4.1 Pay-Per-Inquiry Model

Our Platform operates on a pay-per-inquiry model. When a prospective client submits an inquiry to your business through the Platform, you receive an email notification and may choose to purchase that inquiry to receive the full contact details and message.

**This is not a subscription service.** You only pay when you choose to purchase individual inquiries on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### 4.2 Inquiry Pricing

Pricing for each inquiry is determined by us at our sole discretion and may vary based on:

- The estimated monetary value of services requested
- Geographic market and demand
- Inquiry quality and completeness
- Service category
- Other factors relevant to lead value

We reserve the right to adjust pricing at any time, but price changes will not apply to inquiries you have already purchased.

### 4.3 Complimentary Inquiries

We may, at our sole discretion, provide you with complimentary inquiries at no charge. These may be offered:

- As a promotional credit for new vendors joining the Platform
- For testing or quality assurance purposes
- As goodwill gestures to resolve service issues
- As part of promotional campaigns
- At any other time we deem appropriate

Complimentary inquiries have no cash value, cannot be transferred or sold, and are provided without any guarantee or obligation on our part.

### 4.4 Inquiry Information

When you purchase an inquiry, you will receive the following information submitted by the prospective client:

- Contact information (first name, last name, and email address)
- Services requested
- Estimated wedding date (specific date or estimated timeframe)
- Estimated number of people requesting services
- Service location

You may also receive information such as style preferences, estimated budget, and a message describing the request.

We implement filtering to reduce spam and invalid submissions, but cannot guarantee all inquiries will meet your expectations. Our Real Response Guarantee (Section 4.7) addresses inquiry quality concerns.

### 4.5 Inquiry Notification and Delivery Process

When a prospective client submits an inquiry to your business:

1. You will receive an email notification to your registered vendor account email address
2. The notification will include limited preview information (service type, wedding date, approximate budget range, location)
3. To receive full inquiry details and prospective client contact information, you must purchase the inquiry
4. Payment is currently processed via Stripe or via invoice
5. Once payment is confirmed, you will receive the full inquiry details via email
6. We aim to deliver full inquiry details within 6 hours of payment confirmation, though delivery times may vary due to technical processing or circumstances beyond our reasonable control

**Timing Disclaimer:** While we make reasonable efforts to deliver inquiries promptly, we do not guarantee specific delivery times and are not liable for delays in inquiry delivery.

### 4.6 Payment Methods and Processing

Payment is processed through third-party payment processors using your selected payment method. We reserve the right to change payment methods, processors, or implement in-platform payment processing at any time.

We will provide 30 days advance notice of changes to how you make payments or access purchased inquiries.

All payments are in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for any currency conversion fees, bank fees, or payment processing fees charged by your financial institution or payment processor.

### 4.7 Real Response Guarantee

When you purchase an inquiry, we provide the following quality guarantee:

**Guarantee Coverage:**

1. **Legitimate Inquiry:** The inquiry is from a real prospective client or wedding planner, not spam, bots, or fraudulent submissions
2. **Responsive Client:** The prospective client will respond to your initial outreach within 14 days, provided you reach out promptly and professionally within 48 hours of inquiry purchase

**How to Request a Credit:**

**For Invalid/Spam Inquiries:**
If the inquiry is clearly spam, fraudulent, or from a bot, email support@mail.asianweddingmakeup.com within 30 days of purchase with evidence.

**For Non-Responsive Clients:**
If a legitimate prospective client does not respond to your initial professional outreach within 14 days, email support@mail.asianweddingmakeup.com within 60 days of purchase with:
- Evidence of your prompt initial outreach (email screenshot or proof of sending)
- Confirmation that the client has not responded through any channel

**When the Guarantee Does Not Apply:**

We may deny credit requests if any of the following apply:
- The prospective client responded through channels outside the Platform (phone call, text message, direct email not through Platform, social media)
- You failed to respond to the inquiry within 48 hours of receiving full inquiry details
- Your initial outreach was unprofessional, incomplete, or did not adequately address the inquiry
- You encouraged or induced the prospective client not to respond in order to claim this guarantee
- The prospective client responded but ultimately chose not to book your services (this is normal business and not covered)
- The prospective client's budget did not align with your pricing (normal business)
- You are in violation of these Vendor Terms or our general Terms of Service

**Credit Terms:**
- Credits are issued as account credit for future inquiry purchases
- Credits have no cash value and are non-refundable
- Credits cannot be transferred or sold
- All credit decisions are made at our sole discretion

**Our Commitment:** This guarantee reflects our commitment to vendor satisfaction and Platform quality. While we implement filtering and quality controls, no system is perfect. We will work with you in good faith to address legitimate quality concerns.

### 4.8 Refund Policy

**General Refund Policy:** All inquiry purchases are final. We do not provide refunds except as specifically provided in Section 4.7 (Real Response Guarantee) or as required by applicable law.

**Exception for Billing Errors:** If you believe you were charged in error, contact us at support@mail.asianweddingmakeup.com within 30 days of the charge. We will investigate and issue a refund if we determine a billing error occurred.

### 4.9 Non-Circumvention and Platform Use

- Creating multiple vendor accounts to receive duplicate inquiry notifications

- Immediate suspension or termination of your vendor account
- Forfeiture of any account credits or benefits
- Legal action to recover fees owed plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
- Permanent prohibition from rejoining the Platform

**Permitted Conduct:** This restriction does not prevent you from:

### 5.2 Response Time Expectations

While we do not mandate specific response times, we strongly encourage you to respond to purchased inquiries within 48 hours to provide the best experience for prospective clients and maximize your booking potential. Timely and professional responses help build trust with users and may be considered as one of several factors in how profiles are displayed or highlighted on the Platform.

Failure to respond within 48 hours of an inquiry purchase may make the inquiry ineligible for our Real Response Guarantee (Section 4.7), as described in these Vendor Terms.
